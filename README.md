## Project 3: TV-Script-Generation

In this project, I built a RNN based mini-app that generates new 'fake' Seinfeld TV series scripts based on the patterns it 'learns' from the training data. My Recurent Neural Network is trained on (part of) the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons. 

The main artefacts are:

- Importing Datasets
- Pre-processing data
- Building the RNN
- Selecting hyper-parameters
- Training the RNN
- Generating TV scripts.
